	  <h3>How to Play</h3>
	  Code Monster teaches kids and adults a little about Javascript programming!
	  <br><br>
	  It's easy to play. Follow the instructions and do what Code
	  Monster says.  If you get stuck, just skip to the next lesson.
	  You can always come back to it later!  
	  <br><br>Click on the Back button to go back to a previous
	  lesson (or click on it a bunch to reset the lessons for another
	  player).  Click on the Reset button if you really mess up your
	  code and want to start over on a lesson.
	  <br><br>
	  Code Monster saves what lesson you are on, so feel free to stop
	  at any time and come back later.  As long as you come back on the
	  same browser on the same machine, you'll get back to your lesson.
	  <br><br>
	  Have fun!

	  <h3>About</h3>

	  Code Monster from Crunchzilla is live Javascript programming for
	  fun.  The focus is on action.  Code changes immediately yield
	  visible results.
	  <br><br>
	  Projects start with simple boxes and colors, rapidly progressing
	  into exciting experiments with simple animation and
	  fractals. Important programming concepts like variables, loops,
	  conditionals, expressions, and functions are introduced
	  by example.
	  <br><br> 
	  Code Monster is a gentle and fun introduction to
	  programming concepts.  It is a first step in learning to program. It is
	  not intended to teach all of computer science and programming.
	  <br><br>
	  Code Monster is based in Seattle, WA.  It is part of the
	  Crunchzilla suite of game and educational projects developed by
	  Geeky Ventures.

	  <h3>Privacy Policy</h3> 

	  Code Monster is extremely protective of privacy.  Code Monster
	  keeps almost no information about people who use the website.
	  <br><br>
	  Code Monster does not require registration.  It does not have
	  your e-mail address.  It does not know who you are.  When you
	  use Code Monster, you are essentially anonymous.
	  <br><br>
	  Code Monster does not use cookies.  If you leave the website and
	  come back, there is a feature that will get you back to the
	  lesson you were on.  That does not use cookies.  It is done
	  using HTML5 Local Storage, which stores data on your machine,
	  not remotely on the webservers.  Code Monster does not even know
	  what lesson you were on or how many lessons people using Code
	  Monster have completed, and it is a bit of a shame that we do
	  not, but that is how seriously we take privacy.
	  <br><br> 
	  Like nearly all websites, Code Monster has web server logs that
	  may contain the IP address used to access the web server.  That
	  is standard in nearly all webservers and not an attempt at data
	  collection.
	  <br><br>
	  In keeping with standard language in privacy policies,
	  personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to a
	  third party unless required by law and we may update this policy
	  from time to time at our sole discretion.
	  <br><br>
	  We are very protective of your privacy.  We like it that way.
